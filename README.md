# Coding



This repository contains various projects that I have completed in Matlab, SageMath, and Python during my time as a graduate student in Applied Mathematics at Iowa State University.

*Discrete Optimization* Contains SageMath files on projects that I completed within the area of Discrete Optimiztion.

*Exponential Domination/A Linear Programming Method:* Contains SageMath files related to my thesis work. For further details, see A linear programming method for exponential domination [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06404].

*Machine Learning* contains Matlab and Python files related to classification and regression.

*Spectral Graph Theory* contains SageMath files on projects that I completed within the area of Spectral Graph Theory.
